# Original_killStats
Original version of killStats; PvP stats tracker

This is the first version of this plugin. It was created in Dec of 2012. This version of the plugin is not UUID aware and stores its data
via .yml. This is a very old version of the plugin, all code is very much bundled together and there is not a lot of organization to it at 
all. This is merely uploaded to GitHub so you can look back at the old code if needed.
